IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are three different models for delivering cloud computing services, each with its own level of abstraction and responsibility for managing different aspects of the technology stack. Here's a brief overview of the differences:

    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including virtual machines, storage, and networking. With IaaS, users have more control and flexibility over their computing environment, as they can configure and manage the operating systems, applications, and databases running on the virtual machines. Examples of IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

    Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS provides a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. PaaS typically includes development frameworks, tools, and services that enable users to build and deploy applications quickly and easily. PaaS abstracts the infrastructure layer and allows users to focus on writing code and building applications, without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. Examples of PaaS providers include Heroku, IBM Cloud Foundry, and Google App Engine.

    Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, which are typically accessed through a web browser. With SaaS, users do not need to install or manage any software locally, as the applications are hosted and maintained by the SaaS provider. SaaS applications are typically multi-tenant, meaning they are shared among multiple users, and users typically access them through a subscription-based model. Examples of SaaS applications include Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Microsoft Office 365.

In summary, IaaS provides virtualized computing resources, PaaS provides a platform for developing and deploying applications, and SaaS delivers software applications over the internet. Each model offers different levels of abstraction and responsibility, with IaaS providing the most control and flexibility, PaaS providing an abstracted platform for development, and SaaS providing a fully managed software application.
